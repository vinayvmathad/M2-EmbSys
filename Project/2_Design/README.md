# Components

## Power Supply
- External source of power supply that powers all devices, buttons and microcontroller.

## LEDâ€™s
- Act as a mean to communication with the user.

## Microcontroller
- Performs all operations required by our system. Takes input the signals which the ultrasonic sensor receives and processes them to find the distance between the object and the sensor

## Clock 
- For smooth working of the micro controller.

## Ultrasonic Sensors
- To determine any vehicle presence in front of the sensor.

## LCD display
- To display the information weather the car is front or not. 

## Actuators
- Externally connected devices that perform operation as per the decision which the microcontroller takes. (In my case, Turn ON/Off the heater)
