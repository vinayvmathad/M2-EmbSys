# Components

## Power Supply
- External source of power supply that powers all devices, buttons and microcontroller.

## Buttons
- Act as a circuit breaker to either power the system or isolate the system.

## LEDâ€™s
- Act as a mean to communication with the user.

## Microcontroller
- Performs all operations required by our system. Takes input as Temperature of the room and further processes this data to decide whether heater needs to be turned on/off.

## Clock 
- For smooth working of the micro controller.

## Motion Sensors
- To determine any human presence in the room.

## Temperature Sensors
- To determine the temperature of the room. 

## Actuators
- Externally connected devices that perform operation as per the decision which the microcontroller takes. (In my case, Turn ON/Off the heater)
